AI-Powered Chatbot for Supplier and Product Information
Overview
This project implements an AI-powered chatbot that interacts with a supplier and product database using natural language. The chatbot fetches relevant product and supplier information, summarizes data using a Large Language Model (LLM), and presents it to the user in a conversational interface. It uses LangGraph for agent workflows, FastAPI for the backend, React for the frontend, and MySQL/PostgreSQL for the database.

Features
Natural Language Interaction: Users can query product and supplier information.
LLM Integration: Summarizes product descriptions and supplier details for clarity.
Product Comparison: Allows users to compare multiple products by their attributes.
Chatbot Memory: Recalls user preferences from previous queries.
JWT Authentication: Ensures secure access to the system.
Analytics Dashboard: Tracks popular queries and chatbot usage patterns.

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Python 3.9+ for the backend.
Node.js and npm for the frontend.
Docker for containerization (optional).
MySQL/PostgreSQL for the database.

1. Backend Setup
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chatbot-project.git
cd chatbot-project/backend
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up the database: Update the DATABASE_URL in backend/app/main.py with your MySQL/PostgreSQL connection details.

Run the FastAPI server:
bash
Copy
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
The backend API will be running at http://localhost:8000.

2. Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend folder:
bash
Copy
cd chatbot-project/frontend

Install dependencies:
bash
Copy
npm install

Start the React development server:
bash
Copy
npm start
The frontend will be running at http://localhost:3000.

3. Docker Setup (Optional)
If you prefer to use Docker for containerization, follow these steps:
Build and run the containers:
bash
Copy
docker-compose up --build
This will start the backend, frontend, and MySQL/PostgreSQL database containers. You can access the API at http://localhost:8000 and the frontend at http://localhost:3000.

4. Database Schema Setup
Execute the following SQL queries to set up the Products and Suppliers tables in your MySQL/PostgreSQL database:
sql
Copy
CREATE TABLE Suppliers (
    supplier_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    contact_info VARCHAR(255),
    product_categories_offered TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE Products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    brand VARCHAR(255),
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    category VARCHAR(255),
    description TEXT,
    supplier_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (supplier_id) REFERENCES Suppliers(supplier_id)
);
Populate the tables with sample data for products and suppliers.

How It Works
Backend
FastAPI serves as the backend for handling requests and processing queries from the frontend.
LangGraph is used to manage workflows that handle complex queries (e.g., fetching products, suppliers) and integrate with an LLM for summarization.
SQLAlchemy is used to interact with the database to fetch products and supplier details based on user queries.
JWT Authentication ensures that only authorized users can access the system.
Frontend
React is used to build a responsive UI where users can interact with the chatbot.
Material UI (or Tailwind CSS) is used to style the chat interface and make it visually appealing.
Redux/Context API is used for state management, allowing the app to handle user inputs, responses, and memory across sessions.
Axios makes API calls to the backend to send user queries and display the chatbot responses.
Example Queries
"Show me all products under brand X."
"Which suppliers provide laptops?"
"Give me details of product ABC."
Authentication
JWT tokens are used for secure user authentication. The user must log in before querying certain information.
Development Notes
Enhancing Summarization: The chatbot utilizes an LLM to summarize product descriptions and supplier details. You can replace the placeholder response_summary with a real LLM integration, such as GPT-2/3 or LLaMA 2, to generate better summaries.

Product Comparison: The frontend allows users to select multiple products and compare their attributes side-by-side.

Analytics Dashboard: A simple dashboard tracks popular product categories, frequently asked queries, and user activity.

Troubleshooting
Backend not responding: Ensure your MySQL/PostgreSQL database is running and the credentials are correctly configured in main.py.
Frontend not loading: Check the console for errors, and ensure the backend is running at the correct URL (http://localhost:8000).
